# toprevan

The toprevan is a EC (topre) pcb for trashman's [minivan](https://trashman.wiki/keyboards/minivan) keyboad. The pcb supports the [minisub](https://trashman.wiki/community/pcbs/minisub) layout with both the 625U spacebar and the split 275U, 225U spacebars. The pcb has some of the traymout holes of the original minivan pcb but topre housings (and potentially some domes) need cutting to make that work.

Each layout requires its own respective plate. Various plate files can be found in the production folder. But since there are many different plate styles for the various cases out there, beware that plates could not have been tested beforehand.

***VERSIONS***:
In the production folder you will find both the prototype production files and the revision files (as well as various plate files). Please be aware when ordering pcbs of their differences and what aspects have not been confirmed to work yet.
- The prototype is sporting a standard usb port which limits case compatibility a bit but using o-rings like on the travaulta should mitigate that in a bunch of cases. The rgb breakout has not been tested. Otherwise the pcb is fully working.
- The revision is using another USB port for more compatibility. It also sports all of the traymount holes. The rgb breakout has still not been tested. The revision has not been prototyped yet.

## Firmware

The basic EC firmware is ready to go and the source code is provided for tweaking any settings.

## Plates & Hardware

Plate files are available for OEM (original and deskey housings), for each respective bottom row choice, and for the original plate, Hull and Embrace cases.

Furthermore, you will need 22x 10mm M2 screws and M2 nuts to assemble the pcb. O-rings might help aligning the pcb and usb port in some cases, but is not required.
